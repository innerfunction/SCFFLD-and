/**
 * An interface which must be implemented by configuration proxies.
 * A configuration proxy is a class for objects which are configured in place of objects of
 * another class. They are useful for providing standardized configuration APIs which are
 * consistent across platforms; or for providing simplified configuration interfaces for
 * otherwise difficult to configure objects.
 *
 * Proxies in general should support instantiation both with or without a proxied value. In the
 * second case, it is the responsibility of the proxy to instantiate the value which will be
 * returned by the unwrapValue() method.
 *
 * Proxies should declare a constructor with a single argument which can accept the value being
 * proxied. Proxies should also declare either a no-args constructor, or a constructor accepting
 * a Context object, for when there is no proxied value.
 *
 * Configuration proxy classes should be registered using the Container's registerConfigurationProxy
 * method.
